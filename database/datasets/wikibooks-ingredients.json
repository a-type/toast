{"name":"broth","description":"Broth is a liquid in which meat, seafood, cereal grains, or vegetables have been simmered and strained out. Broth is used as a basis for soups, gravies, sauces, and as a flavor base in many other dishes. Additionally, it can be eaten alone or with a garnish. Broth that has been slowly simmered until it is clarified and substantially reduced (at least by 50%) is known as consommé, which has a substantially more intense flavor due to the reduction. Broths can be further concentrated into pastes or powders and sold commercially, the latter being bullion and often sold as bullion cubes. Their shelf life without preservatives is limited. Commercial preparations also often have large amounts of salt and or MSG added. Bullion cubes in particular have more salt than flavor and will alter the final recipe in many cases if substituted for broth. When it is necessary to clarify a broth (i.e. for a cleaner presentation), egg whites may be added during simmering—the egg whites will coagulate, trapping sediment and turbidity into a readily strainable mass.","attribution":"Content from Wikibooks Cookbook (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Table_of_Contents) Available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)"},

The crop plant, common buckwheat, is Fagopyrum esculentum. Tartary buckwheat (F. tataricum Gaertn.) or \"bitter buckwheat\" is also used as a crop, but it is much less common. Despite the common name and the grain-like use of the crop, buckwheats are not grasses (and are therefore considered pseudocereals) and are not related to wheat nor other monocots. The agricultural weed known as Wild Buckwheat (Fallopia convolvulus) is in the same family, but not closely related to the crop species. Within Fagopyrum, the cultivated species are in the cymosum group, with F. cymosum L. (perennial buckwheat), F. giganteum and F. homotropicum.[1] The wild ancestor of common buckwheat is F. esculentum ssp.ancestrale. F. homotropicum is interfertile with F. esculentum and the wild forms have a common distribution, in Yunnan. The wild ancestor of tartary buckwheat is F. tataricum ssp. potanini.","attribution":"Content from Wikibooks Cookbook (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Table_of_Contents) Available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)"},

{"name":"eggplant","description":"Eggplant (also known as aubergine) is a shiny bulbous vegetable in the nightshade family that comes in green, white, or, more commonly, purple. The eggplant itself is actually a berry, and its edible watertight skin and disc-like seeds show clearly its similarity to peppers and tomatoes. Unlike its cousins, however, the eggplant has a firm, dense flesh that is too bitter to eat raw. Eggplants range in size from large purple gourds bigger than a person's hand to tiny marble-sized green Asian eggplants. The smaller varieties are said to be less bitter and to need less preparation. Many people find eggplant to be an acquired taste. Its versatility leads to eggplant dishes in many different cuisines, from Japan to India to Italy.","attribution":"Content from Wikibooks Cookbook (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Table_of_Contents) Available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)"},
