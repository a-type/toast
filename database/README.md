Various tools and datasets for database migration and maintenance.

## How to migrate

To run migrations, use the [migo](https://github.com/deusdat/arangomigo) CLI and create a valid config file for the environment you want to migrate. If you need configs, ask Grant.

## Datasets

There are some datasets here as well for importing seed data. To import a dataset via the ArangoDB console UI, go to a collection you want to import to and look for the upload button in the top right corner.
